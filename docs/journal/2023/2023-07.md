## Notes

2023-07-08, watch again the clip [[../../unsorted/crash-course-balance-sheet-230708|A Mini Crash Course on the Balance Sheet]]

2023-07-13, update note [[../../unsorted/stock-trading-spreadsheet/index|Trading Journal to Measure Stock Trading Performance With Google Sheets]], where the custom formula now take into account of the transaction type `cash dividend` when calculating `averageCostOfUnsold` and `realizedGainByTicker`.

2023-07-19, I'm curious to learn whether I can extract only a specific stock with its transaction from my dataview-based notes. After researching, I found that it is currently not possible. The same question was asked in [this issue in GitHub](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/issues/1480)

2023-07-21, update note [[../../unsorted/stock-trading-spreadsheet/index|Trading Journal to Measure Stock Trading Performance With Google Sheets]], where the custom formula now use public API from [TCBS](https://www.tcbs.com.vn/en_US/home) to retrieve the `closing price` instead of relying on [IMPORTXML](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en) formula to scrape data from [cafef](https://cafef.vn/thi-truong-chung-khoan.chn). The code was inspired by [this issue from vnstock](https://github.com/thinh-vu/vnstock/issues/10) and the [vn-stocks repo](https://github.com/telosma/vn-stocks).

2023-07-25, update note [[../../unsorted/stock-trading-spreadsheet/index|Trading Journal to Measure Stock Trading Performance With Google Sheets]], where the custom formula now use public API from [SSI](https://iboard.ssi.com.vn/) to retrieve the `closing price`.

2023-07-29, read [[pinescript-tradingview|Pine Script by TradingView]] to understand how technical indicators were built on TradingView.

2023-07-31, rediscover note [[jupyter-alternatives|Alternatives of Jupyter Notebook]]. Add some library to wrangle/visualize data within notebook.
