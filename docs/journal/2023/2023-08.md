## Notes

2023-08-03 learn about [[metadata-in-obsidian-yaml|How metadata is organized in Obsidian]]. I need to write a Dataview query to search for notes having metadata in nested dictionaries.

2023-08-09 update the note [[../../unsorted/stock-trading-spreadsheet/index||stock trading journal]]. I added a new function `getClosePriceEntrade` to retrieve the `closing price` from [DNSE](https://www.dnse.com.vn/).
