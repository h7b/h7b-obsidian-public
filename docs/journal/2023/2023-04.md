## Notes

2023-04-15
- I play with [[transcosmos-da-test-20230415|the entry test for data analyst at Transcosmos]]
- From [this video](https://youtu.be/0yvemzEzt-E?t=158) I learn that I can add an add-in called `Data Analysis` into `Excel for Microsoft 365` (read [text tutorial at Microsoft 365 support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-analysis-toolpak-in-excel-6a63e598-cd6d-42e3-9317-6b40ba1a66b4)), for complex statistical analyses.

- What are the data structures used in daily life?
    - ref: [ByteByteGo](https://blog.bytebytego.com/i/114917564/what-are-the-data-structures-used-in-daily-life)

- US Treasury released DeFi risk report
    - ref: WhiteboardCrypto Newsletter - Apr 14
    - While [the report](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1391) suggests that international actors—specifically North Korean hacker groups—tend to use DeFi to move illicit funds, most criminals still use fiat currencies or other traditional assets for "money laundering, proliferation financing, and terrorist financing." Good to debunk the common idea that decentralization and anonymity means more criminal activity. Actually, since everything on the blockchain is visible, bad actors are [less likely](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022/) to use it.
