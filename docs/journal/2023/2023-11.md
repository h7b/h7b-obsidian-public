November: Wed 01 - Thu 30

## Notes

2023-11-09 I tried to patch Spotify desktop app on Win 10 to bypass their ads and remove podcast section from the homepage. I installed [SpotX](https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX). There are also other approaches for other OS in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/17agabx/how_to_get_free_spotify_premiumadblock_in/), including [[sideload-apps-ios|sideloading to iOS]].

- learn how to [[pandas-json-normalize|flatten a JSON to DataFrame with json_normalize]]
