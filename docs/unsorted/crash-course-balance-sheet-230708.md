# A Mini Crash Course on the Balance Sheet

Watch and take note the clip [A Mini Crash Course on the Balance Sheet. Everything you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sx5nyY0cxc).

So many things that I almost forgot
- the basic principles of accounting, how to make a journal entry
- DEALER: a mnemonic to remember how to write Debit/Credit for each type of account (Debt, Expense, Asset; Liability, Equity, Revenue)
- how to establish a Balance Sheet
- the relationship between Income Statement and Balance Sheet
- Balance Sheet KPI
    - DIO (Days of Inventory Outstanding), DSO (Days Sales Outstanding), DPO (Days Payables Outstanding), Cash Conversion Cycle
- [Typical questions you should ask yourself when reading a Balance Sheet](https://youtu.be/7sx5nyY0cxc?t=3258)
    - Does the company have sufficient cash on hand to pay its bill? -> check Cash Runway
    - Does the company have collection issues? -> check Days Sales Outstanding
    - Is there stale inventory on the books? -> check Inventory Aging Report
    - Are there any obsolete equipment?
    - Does the company owe suppliers longer than 90 days? -> check Accounts Payable Aging Report
    - Does the firm have too much debt? -> check Debt-to-Equity ratio
    - Check whether the firm has the capability to deliver product, in order to claim the Deferred Revenue?
    - Does the equity include the contribution from its owner? -> check the Cap Table
